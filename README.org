* Sente example app

** Deprecation notice

This project is not going to be maintained further by me. If there are any volunteers to take over, please come forward. I recommend referring to [[https://github.com/danielsz/system-websockets][system-websockets]] for wiring Sente in Clojure projects.

** What is this?

The [[https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente/tree/master/example-project][example app]] from Sente, but for [[https://github.com/danielsz/system][system]] (componentized and bootified).

** Usage

Fire the Boot pipeline from the command line.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ boot dev
#+END_SRC

Then point your browser to [[http://localhost:3019]]
